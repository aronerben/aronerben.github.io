I've recently started meditating outside on public benches. This way I get my sun and my mindfulness session in at the same time. I just pick any bench and sit down for my 20 minute routine. The first couple of times are a bit harder than in the comfort of your living room or bedroom, where you're all by yourself. Once you get past the thought of getting knockout gamed any second with your eyes closed or mistaking any itch on your body for a bug that's slowly making its way into your ear, then the outside setting really enhances the experience in my opinion.

Of course, people will walk past, but you get used to just powering through and not letting it rip you out of the zone. I suggest using headphones if you're doing guided meditation, so the outside noises don't interrupt too much. Make sure to also bring sunglasses if it's sunny. If your eyelids are as thin as mine, every shadow cast by people walking by will directly project into your eyeball. Also, I find it harder to keep my eyes shut in bright light.

So overall, go try it, if you haven't yet. You can also go sit in some grass, which makes the bug situation feel worse.
