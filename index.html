  <h2>What's all this, then?</h2>
  <p>
    I'm Aron. Many people mistake me for the guy with 2 a, I don't know who that
    is, all I know is that's not me.
  </p>
  <p>
    On this blog I write about stuff that I think about, mainly math,
    programming and occasionally societal or political topics.

  <h2>What's in it for me, Aaron?</h2>
  <p>
    Please don't. Maybe you will find some topics that interest you! Have a look
    in the blog section. If you feel like shooting me a message, check the about
    page.

  <h2>Are your posts rigorous or handwavy?</h2>
  <p>
    Great question, I hoped you would ask! I try to keep my technical posts as
    accurate as possible, but since I treat this blog as my personal thought
    latrine, some parts may be opinion and intuition based. This warning allows
    me to omit all future "imo"s.
